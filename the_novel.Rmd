This is my in-progress analysis of the novel I am writing.  

```{r}
# TODO - write a novel
# TODO - automate the creation of files and storing of raw words
# TODO - learn text mining
# TODO - analyse and report on the process and output 

```


# Data collection

Words are written daily in the Flowstate app, collected weekly and stored locally.  

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Set working directory
setwd("/Users/williambidstrup/GitHub/the_novel")

# Install and load packages
install.packages("tidyverse", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
library(tidyverse)

install.packages("tidytext", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
library(tidytext)

install.packages("wordcloud", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")
library(wordcloud)

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Import new data (from local host database)
new_novel <- read_lines("/Users/williambidstrup/Documents/Words/6.\ Data/the_novel_DATA/2017-12-30_the_novel.txt")

# Make data frame
new_novel <- data_frame(text = new_novel) #Insert number of lines as required

# Make tidy
new_novel_tidy <- new_novel %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

# Add snapshot date
new_novel_tidy$snapshot <- as.Date("2017-12-30")


```


```{r, include = FALSE}
# TODO - find a way to remove numbers via REGEX

# No stop_words set
data(stop_words)

novel_clean <- new_novel_tidy %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}


novel_clean %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = novel_clean %>%
         group_by(snapshot) %>%
         summarise(count = n()), aes(x = snapshot, y = count, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_dark() +
  labs(title = "", x = "" , y = "",
       subtitle = "",
       caption = expression(paste(italic("")))) 

```



I am starting with a few thousand words already under my belt. These will be added to as the first draft develops. The basic concept of the novel may be gleaned from this word cloud...  

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
# TODO - find out how to look at wordcloud per snapshot date using pwalk or similar
# TODO - remove numbers with stringr

novel_clean %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  filter(! word %in% c("f0", "85", "it_s", "pardeftab720", "sl360", "u8232", "cf2", "pard", "uc0", "sl280", "partightenfactor0")) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 120))

```
